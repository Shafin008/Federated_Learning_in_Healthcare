***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on earthquake data from Bangladesh (1970-2021). The dataset was collected from IRIS IEB website and contained information on earthquake magnitude, depth, location (longitude & latitude), and time of occurrence.***

## Execution Details

**1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**

- Dataset: The dataset was saved and loaded in a CSV file format

- Tools Used:

    - Python for analysis.

    - Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing and statistical analysis.

    - Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization.

- Preprocessing Steps:

    - Checked dataset structure using

    - Filtered relevant data for earthquakes occurring in:

        - BANGLADESH

        - INDIA-BANGLADESH BORDER REGION

        - BAY OF BENGAL

        - MYANMAR-BANGLADESH BORDER REGION

    - Converted timestamps into readable date formats.
    - Focused on earthquakes with magnitude ≥ 3.5 for significant event analysis.

**2. Data Exploration & Key Visualizations**

A. Earthquake Magnitude Distribution
* Graph Used: Histogram of Magnitude (Seaborn displot)
* Findings:
    * Most earthquakes had a magnitude below 4.0, indicating low to moderate seismic activity.
    * A smaller number of earthquakes had a magnitude above 5.0, which could cause structural damage.
B. Depth Distribution of Earthquakes
* Graph Used: Histogram of Depth (Seaborn displot)
* Findings:
    * Most earthquakes occurred at shallow depths (0-50 km).
    * Deeper earthquakes (more than 100 km) were less frequent.
C. Geographical Distribution of Earthquakes
* Graph Used: Scatter Plot of Latitude vs. Longitude with Magnitude (sns.scatterplot)
* Findings:
    * Earthquakes were concentrated near border regions and coastal areas (Bay of Bengal).
    * Higher magnitude earthquakes (≥4.0) were scattered across multiple regions.
D. Relationship Between Magnitude and Depth
* Graph Used: Hexbin Plot (sns.jointplot(kind='hex'))
* Findings:
    * No strong correlation between magnitude and depth.
    * Some high-magnitude earthquakes occurred at shallow depths, increasing their potential impact.
E. Monthly & Seasonal Trends of Earthquakes
* Graphs Used:
    * Bar Plot of Earthquake Count by Month (sns.countplot)
    * Bar Plot of Magnitude by Month (sns.barplot)
* Findings:
    * Earthquakes were evenly distributed throughout the year with no significant seasonal trend.
    * Higher magnitude earthquakes (≥4.0) were more frequent in March, May, and October.
F. Daily Trends of Earthquakes
* Graphs Used:
    * Bar Plot of Magnitude by Day of the Month
    * Count Plot of Earthquake Frequency by Day
* Findings:
    * Earthquakes did not show a clear pattern based on days of the month.
    * Some peaks were observed on specific days, but they might be random variations.
G. Decadal Analysis of Earthquake Trends
* Graph Used: Count Plot of Earthquake Occurrences by Decade
* Findings:
    * Increase in recorded earthquakes over time.
    * The 2000-2009 decade had the highest number of earthquakes.
    * This could be due to better monitoring technology rather than an actual increase in earthquakes.

Key Takeaways
Earthquake Activity in Bangladesh is Moderate: Most earthquakes have a magnitude below 4.0.
Shallow Earthquakes are More Common: Most earthquakes occur at depths of 0-50 km, which can have surface-level impacts.
Geographical Risk Areas Identified: The Bay of Bengal and border regions experience frequent earthquakes. Increasing Trend Over Decades: More earthquakes have been recorded over time, possibly due to better monitoring systems.
